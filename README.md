This is my basic script for ensuring docker containers and services within the containers will automatically start upon a restart or general failure.

Personally, I use it in different ways; BUT this is the foundation to some of my own init scripts I use instead of systemd or init.rc.
A great learning tool for any person attempting to learn linux and programming at the same time. :D
